A simple webapp example using NodeJS's Express.

Loosely following instructions at: https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/11/15/node-express-typescript

Initialized with 
```
npm init
```

All the defaults were used when prompted to create the package.json

Install express with 
```
npm install express
```

Created `src/index.js` and updated `package.json`: changed `main` property and added a `start` script.

# Set up TypeScript

Run to install TypeScript compiler:
```
npm install --save-dev typescript  
```

Added `tsconfig.json` file. This can be autogenerated with:
```
npx tsc --init
```
Some settings made to match those listed here: https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/11/15/node-express-typescript#set-up-your-nodejs-project-to-use-typescript

The TypeScript compiler will compile files in the `src` folder and place the results in the `dist` folder.

Added Typescript linting:
```
npm install --save-dev tslint
```

Added `tslint.json`. This can be autogenerated with:
```
npx tslint --init
```
Some settings are changed from the default.

Updated `package.json` to point main to the new `dist` folder, and with a few new scripts for prebuild, build, and prestart.

Changed `index.js` extension from `.js` to `.ts`.

Finally, run with:

```
npm run start
```

Note: You can run TSLint and the TypeScript compiler without starting the Node.js server using `npm run build`.

# TypeScript errors

Updated the `index.ts` to address some linter/compiler errors.

Update your project with some TypeScript declaration files so that TypeScript can use the type declarations for Node.js and Express.
```
npm install --save-dev @types/node @types/express
```

# Build a Better User Interface with Materialize and EJS

Adding Materialize and EJS.
Install EJS with:
```
npm install ejs
```

Add new folder in `src` called `views`, and a file called `index.ejs`.

Updated `index.ts` with code to use EJS as the view engine and render the index template for the home page.

Install more modules and TypeScript declarations needed to copy other types of files from src to dist:
```
npm install --save-dev ts-node shelljs fs-extra nodemon rimraf npm-run-all
npm install --save-dev @types/fs-extra @types/shelljs
```

Added a folder called `tools` and a new script called `copyAssets.ts`

## Update npm scripts

Update the scripts in `package.json`.

Finally, run with:

```
npm run dev
```


# Configuration Settings with Node.js

Instead of environment variables, use dotenv.

```
npm install dotenv
npm install --save-dev @types/dotenv
```

Create a `.env` file.
