A simple webapp example using NodeJS's Express.

Loosely following instructions at: https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/11/15/node-express-typescript

Initialized with 
```
npm init
```

All the defaults were used when prompted to create the package.json

Install express with 
```
npm install express
```

Created `src/index.js` and updated `package.json`: changed `main` property and added a `start` script.

# Set up TypeScript

Run to install TypeScript compiler:
```
npm install --save-dev typescript  
```

Added `tsconfig.json` file. This can be autogenerated with:
```
npx tsc --init
```
Some settings made to match those listed here: https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/11/15/node-express-typescript#set-up-your-nodejs-project-to-use-typescript

The TypeScript compiler will compile files in the `src` folder and place the results in the `dist` folder.

Added Typescript linting:
```
npm install --save-dev tslint
```

Added `tslint.json`. This can be autogenerated with:
```
npx tslint --init
```
Some settings are changed from the default.

Updated `package.json` to point main to the new `dist` folder, and with a few new scripts for prebuild, build, and prestart.

Changed `index.js` extension from `.js` to `.ts`.

Finally, run with:

```
npm run start
```

Note: You can run TSLint and the TypeScript compiler without starting the Node.js server using `npm run build`.
