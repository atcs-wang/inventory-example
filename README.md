A simple webapp example using NodeJS's Express.

Loosely following instructions at: https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/11/15/node-express-typescript

Initialized with 
```
npm init
```

All the defaults were used when prompted to create the package.json

Install express with 
```
npm install express
```

Created `src/index.js` and updated `package.json`: changed `main` property and added a `start` script.
